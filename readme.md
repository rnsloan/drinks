# Drinks

Testing out some things with parceljs, TypeScript, css-in-js, firebase.

## Backend

Data from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/ai-first/cocktail-ingredients](https://www.kaggle.com/ai-first/cocktail-ingredients).

Read-only backend using [datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) deployed on [zeit](https://zeit.co/now). **It is not** evaling SQL statements via a user with full CRUD capabilities which would be a terrible idea.
